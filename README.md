## ⚙️ Installation

January requires **Go version** `1.18` or **higher** to run. If you need to install or upgrade Go, visit the [official Go download page](https://go.dev/dl/). 

To start setting up your project download the **January-CLI** tool
from here [January-CLI](https://github.com/akshanshgusain/january-cli)
or,

**Homebrew installation**: coming soon!


## ⚡️ Quickstart

Here is  a basic example to create a simple web app with **January-CLI**:
```bash
./january-cli new github.com/your_username/your-repository_name
```
This command creates a new project folder named **your-repository-name**.
After creating the project move the CLI to the project folder :

```bash
mv ./january-cli ./your-repository-name
```
and cd into the project folder:
```bash
cd your-repository-name/
```
The app comes bundled with a Makefile(currently only support macOS). Run the web app running:
```bash
make start
